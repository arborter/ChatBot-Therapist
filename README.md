ChatBot Therapist

This bot uses Python 2.7.

DISCLAIMER: this bot is not a professional. This bot was purely created for the purpose of understanding natural language processing in a machine, and nothing else. Nothing the bot states should be seen as professional advice.

The ChatBot Therapist is a simple chat bot I have designed for the purpose of talking through some emotional issue with the individual. Its specific tags spawned from the names of human emotions. 

This simple application showcases my ability to learn something new and apply it to a project.

To use it, you must tell it what emotion you feel in the moment, and then the bot will work from there. The bot needs a "root" emotion to work with.

Below are the directions to use this bot.

Project structure
application - flask app (main application)

QuickStart:

First and foremost, you will want to open your terminal and create an environment. 

After you have created the environment, type: 
"pip install -r requirements.txt.

I have put in that documents all dependencies to run the flask application.
Now that the dependencies are installed, you are ready to use the bot. Below are the steps to run it: 

1. Create the pickle file by loading the main.py code in your terminal. You will type in your terminal "python -i main.py" After you have done that, you should see the pickle file in your directory. 

2. Run that app.py file in your terminal by typing "python -i main.py"

Voila, now you can run the chatbot from your terminal (:
