ChatBot Therapist

The ChatBot Therapist is a simple chat bot I have designed for the purpose of talking through some emotional issue with the individual. Its specific tags spawned from the names of human emotions. 

This simple application showcases my ability to learn cloud technology, AWS, and my ability to create such an application with this architecture from scratch then fully deploy it.

To use it, you must tell it what emotion you feel in the moment, and then the bot will work from there. The bot needs a "root" emotion to work with.
