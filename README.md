ChatBot Therapist

DISCLAIMER: this bot is not a professional. This bot was purely created for the purpose of understadning natural language processing in a machine, and nothing else. Nothing the bot states should be seen as professional advice.

The ChatBot Therapist is a simple chat bot I have designed for the purpose of talking through some emotional issue with the individual. Its specific tags spawned from the names of human emotions. 

This simple application showcases my ability to learn cloud technology, AWS, and my ability to create such an application with this architecture from scratch then fully deploy it.

To use it, you must tell it what emotion you feel in the moment, and then the bot will work from there. The bot needs a "root" emotion to work with.

The bot currently works in Flask. I am in the process of transferring its use to AWS.

To use the bot, first create the pickle file by loading the main.py code in your terminal. After you have done that, run that app.py file in your terminal. Voila, you have a chatbot that tries to help you through your emotions.
